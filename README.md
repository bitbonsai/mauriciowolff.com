=================

Personal site of Mauricio Wolff (bitbonsai) using Twitter's Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate Google Closure Compiler on JS/CSS and other nifty techniques to build a small site.

Intent
------

I wanted to experiment Twitter's Bootstrap, and see how it can fit HTML5 Boilerplate, as well as some other web optimizations. 

In terms of JS, I'm using a singleton approach to write the page's features, you can check the object mw at the console.

Next steps
----------

Replace Boilerplate's default CSS with bootstrap and build the site using ANT, use microcontents, humans.txt, OpenGraph support, random gradient colors for header and footer.

### Notice

This was a couple hours project on a nice sunny weekend... So bear with me if something isn't perfect :)
